    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A dosa is a thin, savoury crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground white gram and rice. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar. Dosas are popular in South Asia as well as around the world.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups rice</li>
        <li>½ cup poha</li>
        <li>½ cup urad dal</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chana dal</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fenugreek seeds</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil or cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Allow the rice and dal and other ingredients to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Blend the batter</li>
        <li>Place the batter in a large bowl, giving it room to expand, and then place it in a warm spot.</li>
        <li>Heat a well-seasoned cast iron griddle or a non-stick griddle over high heat.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter on the center of the griddle and, working quickly, move out in circles in a spiraling motion, spreading the batter with the bottom of the ladle.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a few drops of oil around the dosa edges.</li>
        <li>Once the dosa edges look lacy and golden, and the top has dried out, loosen it gently from the griddle with a flat spatula. Fold the dosa in half and remove to a plate.</li>
    </ol>
